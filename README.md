### Introduction
#### Objective
To unify Delta Airlinesâ€™ siloed customer data into Salesforce Data Cloud, creating a single source of truth for each customer.

#### Key Features
- Data Streaming
- Data Mapping
- Profile Unification

### Business Use case
    
#### Problem Statement

 Delta Airlines faces challenges in staying competitive due to data silos and a lack of actionable insights. The companyâ€™s data is scattered across siloed systems making it difficult to gain a unified view of customer profiles. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies in resolving customer issues, a lack of actionable business insights, and an inability to devise data-driven strategies.

 **Acceptance Criteria**
    
- Data streaming from all sources is automated and validated for accuracy.
- Source data is appropriately mapped to Data Model Objects (DMO)
- A unified profile of each customer is created

**2.  Customer Service Agent**

As a **Customer Service Agent**, **I need** a 360-degree view of customer profiles **so that I can** resolve customer inquiries quickly and provide personalized support.
        
**Acceptance Criteria**

 ### Lessons Learned
    
**Challenges Faced**

- Creating and ingesting my data from a local file source was fraught with error and inefficiencies, so I resorted to using Amazon S3 and Salesforce CRM as my data sources.
- Mapping the Profile category data correctly to the appropriate DMOs in order to create identity resolution. Eventually I mapped the Profile category data to the Individual, Contact Point Email, Party Identification and Party DMOs
